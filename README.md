# Sequence Alignment for Biomolecular Computing

### Some important algorithms implemented in Python

The present work show the application of global, local and semi global alignments algorithms and variants of them for sequences comparison. This is very useful in molecular biology labores but that algorithms requirement and high memory capacity and time to run.
